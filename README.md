# Hopfield-network-training

This project was made for the University class "Logic Programming".
The task was to define a hopfield predicate, which, when called with a first argument a
list of vectors to be stored on a Hopfield network, to return to the second argument, a
table of the network weights

# What I Learned

* Hopfield networks theory and training
* Basic Prolog features
